# Fable Asset Browser: Legendary Edition 2.0 (F.A.B.L.E.2)

Browse and export a variety of Fable 2 files. Included features:

- Search and filter the internal files in the .bnk files
- Export all of the assets.
- Playback of audio files (WIP).
- Exports Audio files in a usable format. 
- Extract 3D models, textures, and more (WIP, currently exports most rigged models with UV's and skeletons. It's a little buggy, RN. NO TEXTURES YET)

  
How to use:
- Rip a legitimate copy of Fable 2 to your PC.
- Download FABLE2 from releases and run it.
- To export as GLB, select a .mdl file, then click "convert to glb"
